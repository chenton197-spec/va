    Typical startup sequence
    ------------------------
    ::

        g.motor.set_mode(ControlMode.POS_VEL)   # 1. pick a control mode
        g.motor.enable()                          # 2. energize the motor
        g.motor.refresh()                         # 3. read initial state
        print(g.state.position)                   # 4. use the state

    Notes
    -----
    - ``set_mode()`` must be called before ``enable()``.  Calling ``enable()``
      without a prior ``set_mode()`` leaves the motor in whatever mode it was
      last saved to flash.
    - All methods require an active connection; they raise
      :class:`~gloria_m_sdk.exceptions.GloriaConnectionError` otherwise.
    """

    def enable(self) -> None:
        """Energize the motor and enter the active control state.

        Sends the enable command over CAN and waits for the motor to echo back
        a live feedback frame.  After this call the motor will actively resist
        disturbances according to the current control mode and parameters.

        Call this **after** :meth:`set_mode` and before any motion command.
        Calling enable on an already-enabled motor is safe (no-op on the
        motor side).

        the encoder index with the mechanical home position.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mode:
            The desired control mode.  Common values:

            - ``ControlMode.MIT``     — MIT torque/impedance control (kp, kd, tau).
              Used for force-controlled gripping.
            - ``ControlMode.POS_VEL`` — Position + velocity target (PV mode).
              Used for smooth positional moves.

        Raises
        ------
        GloriaModeError
            If the motor does not echo back the expected mode within the retry
            window (typically 3 attempts, ~150 ms total).  Check CAN wiring
            and motor power if this is raised unexpectedly.

        Notes
        -----
        - Mode switches take ~50–100 ms because the controller retries and
          waits for a feedback frame with the new mode field.
        - Always call ``set_mode()`` before ``enable()`` when starting a
          session, to ensure the motor is in a known state.
